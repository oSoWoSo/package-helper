# package-helper
A helper for building Void Linux's XBPS packages from source.

# Usage
```
  ./package-build-helper.sh [package name]
```
Simply supply the package name to [package name] and you're off to go!

### Note
You should have already bootstrapped xbps-src: if not then do it. I recommend to perform
a binary bootstrap since it's faster to get started.
